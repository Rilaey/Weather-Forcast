# Weather Dashboard

## Description 

- Behind this project was the motivation to have a custom weather dashboard that allows the user to view any city they prefer and get a current and future 5 day weather forcast.

- The problem this project solves is that it gives the user a simple and very well layed out description of the weather they wish to know.

- During the duration of the project I learned my way around the OpenWeatherMapApi along with implementing the value that was returned and laying it out on the page for the user to enjoy.
